Program: Tracer.java

Description: Tracer class is for tracing purposes. So when you add a piece of code in your program to help you figure out where the error is you can track it down more efficiently as well as turn it on and off as you see fit. This way you can leave in your tracing while also being able to turn it back on when needed.
